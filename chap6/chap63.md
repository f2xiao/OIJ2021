# 6.3 Iteration

We can use a clean enhanced for loop with Java's `HashSet`

```java
Set<String> s = new HashSet<>();
s.add("Tokyo");
s.add("Lagos");
for (String city : s) {
    System.out.println(city);
}
```

However, if we try to do the same with our `ArraySet`, we get an error. How can we enable this functionality?

## Enhanced For Loop

Let's first understand what is happening when we use an enhanced for loop. We can "translate" an enhanced for loop into an ugly, manual approach.

```java
Set<String> s = new HashSet<>();
...
for (String city : s) {
    ...
}
```

The above code translates to:

```java
Set<String> s = new HashSet<>();
...
Iterator<String> seer = s.iterator();
while (seer.hasNext()) {
    String city = seer.next();
    ...
}
```

Letâ€™s strip away the magic so we can build our own classes that support this.

The key here is an object called an _iterator_.

For our example, in List.java we might define an `iterator()` method that returns an iterator object.

```java
public Iterator<E> iterator();
```

Now, we can use that object to loop through all the entries in our list:

```java
List<Integer> friends = new ArrayList<Integer>();
...
Iterator<Integer> seer = friends.iterator();

while (seer.hasNext()) {
System.out.println(seer.next());
}
```

This code behaves identically to the foreach loop version above.

There are three key methods in our iterator approach:

First, we get a new iterator object with `Iterator<Integer> seer = friends.iterator();`

Next, we loop through the list with our while loop. We check that there are still items left with `seer.hasNext()`, which will return true if there are unseen items remaining, and false if all items have been processed.

Last, `seer.next()` does two things at once. It returns the next element of the list, and here we print it out. It also advances the iterator by one item. In this way, the iterator will only inspect each item once.

## Implementing Iterators

In this section, we are going to talk about how to build a class to support iteration.

Let's start by thinking about what the compiler need to know in order to successfully compile the following iterator example:

```java
List<Integer> friends = new ArrayList<Integer>();
Iterator<Integer> seer = friends.iterator();

while(seer.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println(seer.next());
}
```

We can look at the static types of each object that calls a relevant method. `friends` is a List, on which `iterator()` is called, so we must ask:

* Does the List interface have an iterator\(\) method?

`seer` is an Iterator, on which `hasNext()` and `next()` are called, so we must ask:

* Does the Iterator interface have next/hasNext\(\) methods?

So how do we implement these requirements?

The List interface extends the Iterable interface, inheriting the abstract iterator\(\) method. \(Actually, List extends Collection which extends Iterable, but it's easier to codethink of this way to start.\)

```java
public interface Iterable<T> {
    Iterator<T> iterator();
}
```

```java
public interface List<T> extends Iterable<T>{
    ...
}
```

Next, the compiler checks that Iterators have `hasNext()` and `next()`. The Iterator interface specifies these abstract methods explicitly:

```java
public interface Iterator<T> {
    boolean hasNext();
    T next();
}
```

### What if someone calls `next` when `hasNext` returns false?

```text
This behavior is undefined. However, a common convention is to throw a `NoSuchElementException`. See [Discussion 5](https://sp19.datastructur.es/materials/discussion/disc05sol.pdf) for examples.
```

### Will `hasNext` always be called before `next`?

```text
Not necessarily. This is sometimes the case when someone using the iterator knows exactly how many elements are in the sequence. Thus, we can't rely on the user calling `hasNext` before `next`. However, you can always call `hasNext` from within your `next` function.
```

Specific classes will implement their own iteration behaviors for the interface methods. Let's look at an example. \(Note: if you want to build this up from the start, follow along with the live coding in the video.\)

We are going to add iteration through keys to our ArrayMap class. First, we write a new class called ArraySetIterator, nested inside of ArraySet:

```java
private class ArraySetIterator implements Iterator<T> {
    private int wizPos;

    public ArraySetIterator() {
        wizPos = 0;
    }

    public boolean hasNext() {
        return wizPos < size;
    }

    public T next() {
        T returnItem = items[wizPos];
        wizPos += 1;
        return returnItem;
    }
}
```

This ArraySetIterator implements a `hasNext()` method, and a `next()` method, using a `wizPos` position as an index to keep track of its position in the array. For a different data structure, we might implement these two methods differently.

**Thought Excercise:** How would you design `hasNext()` and `next()` for a linked list?

Now that we have the appropriate methods, we could use a ArraySetIterator to iterate through an ArrayMap:

```java
ArraySet<Integer> aset = new ArraySet<>();
aset.add(5);
aset.add(23);
aset.add(42);

Iterator<Integer> iter = aset.iterator();

while(iter.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println(iter.next());
}
```

We still want to be able to support the enhanced for loop, though, to make our calls cleaner. So, we need to make ArrayMap implement the Iterable interface. The essential method of the Iterable interface is `iterator()`, which returns an Iterator object for that class. All we have to do is return an instance of our `ArraySetIterator` that we just wrote!

```java
public Iterator<T> iterator() {
    return new ArraySetIterator();
}
```

Now we can use enhanced for loops with our `ArrraySet`!

```java
ArraySet<Integer> aset = new ArraySet<>();
...
for (int i : aset) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

Here we've seen **Iterable**, the interface that makes a class able to be iterated on, and requires the method `iterator()`, which returns an Iterator object. And we've seen **Iterator**, the interface that defines the object with methods to actually do that iteration. You can think of an Iterator as a machine that you put onto an iterable that facilitates the iteration. Any iterable is the object on which the iterator is performing.

With these two components, you can make fancy for loops for your classes!

`ArraySet` code with iteration support is below:

```java
import java.util.Iterator;

public class ArraySet<T> implements Iterable<T> {
    private T[] items;
    private int size; // the next item to be added will be at position size

    public ArraySet() {
        items = (T[]) new Object[100];
        size = 0;
    }

    /* Returns true if this map contains a mapping for the specified key.
     */
    public boolean contains(T x) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i += 1) {
            if (items[i].equals(x)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    /* Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map.
       Throws an IllegalArgumentException if the key is null. */
    public void add(T x) {
        if (x == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("can't add null");
        }
        if (contains(x)) {
            return;
        }
        items[size] = x;
        size += 1;
    }

    /* Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map. */
    public int size() {
        return size;
    }

    /** returns an iterator (a.k.a. seer) into ME */
    public Iterator<T> iterator() {
        return new ArraySetIterator();
    }

    private class ArraySetIterator implements Iterator<T> {
        private int wizPos;

        public ArraySetIterator() {
            wizPos = 0;
        }

        public boolean hasNext() {
            return wizPos < size;
        }

        public T next() {
            T returnItem = items[wizPos];
            wizPos += 1;
            return returnItem;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArraySet<Integer> aset = new ArraySet<>();
        aset.add(5);
        aset.add(23);
        aset.add(42);

        //iteration
        for (int i : aset) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }

}
```

# 6.4 Object Methods

All classes inherit from the overarching Object class. The methods that are inherited are as follows:

* `String toString()`
* `boolean equals(Object obj)`
* `Class <?> getClass()`
* `int hashCode()`
* `protected Objectclone()`
* `protected void finalize()`
* `void notify()`
* `void notifyAll()`
* `void wait()`
* `void wait(long timeout)`
* `void wait(long timeout, int nanos)`

We are going to focus on the first two in this chapter. We will take advantage of inheritance to override these two methods in our classes to behave in the ways we want them to.

## toString\(\)

The `toString()` method provides a string representation of an object. The `System.out.println()` function implicitly calls this method on whatever object is passed to it and prints the string returned. When you run `System.out.println(dog)`, it's actually doing this:

```java
String s = dog.toString()
System.out.println(s)
```

The default `Object` class' `toString()` method prints the location of the object in memory. This is a hexidecimal string. Classes like Arraylist and java arrays have their own overridden versions of the `toString()` method. This is why, when you were working with and writing tests for Arraylist, errors would always return the list in a nice format like this \(1, 2, 3, 4\) instead of returning the memory location.

For classes that we've written by ourselves like `ArrayDeque`, `LinkedListDeque`, etc, we need to provide our own `toString()` method if we want to be able to see the objects printed in a readable format.

Let's try to write this method for an `ArraySet` class. Read the `ArraySet` class below and make sure you understand what the various methods do. Feel free to plug the code into java visualizer to get a better understanding!

```java
import java.util.Iterator;

public class ArraySet<T> implements Iterable<T> {
    private T[] items;
    private int size; // the next item to be added will be at position size

    public ArraySet() {
        items = (T[]) new Object[100];
        size = 0;
    }

    /* Returns true if this map contains a mapping for the specified key.
     */
    public boolean contains(T x) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i += 1) {
            if (items[i].equals(x)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    /* Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map.
       Throws an IllegalArgumentException if the key is null. */
    public void add(T x) {
        if (x == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("can't add null");
        }
        if (contains(x)) {
            return;
        }
        items[size] = x;
        size += 1;
    }

    /* Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map. */
    public int size() {
        return size;
    }

    /** returns an iterator (a.k.a. seer) into ME */
    public Iterator<T> iterator() {
        return new ArraySetIterator();
    }

    private class ArraySetIterator implements Iterator<T> {
        private int wizPos;

        public ArraySetIterator() {
            wizPos = 0;
        }

        public boolean hasNext() {
            return wizPos < size;
        }

        public T next() {
            T returnItem = items[wizPos];
            wizPos += 1;
            return returnItem;
        }
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        /* hmmm */
    }


    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        /* hmmm */
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArraySet<Integer> aset = new ArraySet<>();
        aset.add(5);
        aset.add(23);
        aset.add(42);

        //iteration
        for (int i : aset) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }

        //toString
        System.out.println(aset);

        //equals
        ArraySet<Integer> aset2 = new ArraySet<>();
        aset2.add(5);
        aset2.add(23);
        aset2.add(42);

        System.out.println(aset.equals(aset2));
        System.out.println(aset.equals(null));
        System.out.println(aset.equals("fish"));
        System.out.println(aset.equals(aset));
}
```

You can find the [solutions here \(ArraySet.java\)](https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/lectureCode-sp19/blob/af2325c600010a8894a6ce3a3ccf517547145ec1/inheritance4/ArraySet.java)

**Exercise 6.4.1:** Write the toString\(\) method so that when we print an ArraySet, it prints the elements separated by commas inside of curly braces. i.e {1, 2, 3, 4}. Remember, the toString\(\) method should return a string.

**Solution**

```java
public String toString() {
    String returnString = "{";
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i += 1) {
        returnString += keys[i];
        returnString += ", ";
    }
    returnString += "}";
    return returnString;
}
```

This solution, although seemingly simple and elegant, is actually very naive. This is because when you use string concatenation in Java like so: `returnString += keys[i];` you are actually not just appending to `returnString`, you are creating an entirely new string. This is incredibly inefficient because creating a new string object takes time too! Specifically, linear in the length of the string.

**Bonus Question:** Let's say concatenating one character to a string takes 1 second. If we have an ArraySet of size 5: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, how long would it take to run the `toString()` method?

**Answer:** We set `returnString` to the left bracket which takes one second because this involves adding `{` to the empty string `""`. Adding the first element will involve creating an entirely new string, adding } and 1 which would take 2 seconds. Adding the second element takes 3 seconds because we need to add `{`, `1`, `2`. This process continues, so for the entire array set the total time is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7.`

To remedy this, Java has a special class called `StringBuilder`. It creates a string object that is mutable, so you can continue appending to the same string object instead of creating a new one each time.

**Exercise 6.4.2:** Rewrite the toString\(\) method using StringBuilder.

**Solution**

```java
public String toString() {
        StringBuilder returnSB = new StringBuilder("{");
        for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; i += 1) {
            returnSB.append(items[i].toString());
            returnSB.append(", ");
        }
        returnSB.append(items[size - 1]);
        returnSB.append("}");
        return returnSB.toString();
    }
```

Now you've successfully overridden the `toString()` method! Try printing the ArraySet to see the fruits of your work.

Next we will override another important object method: `equals()`

## equals\(\)

`equals()` and `==` have different behaviors in Java. `==` Checks if two objects are actually the same object in memory. Remember, pass-by-value! `==` checks if two boxes hold the same thing. For primitives, this means checking if the values are equal. For objects, this means checking if the address/pointer is equal.

Say we have this `Doge` class:

```java
public class Doge {

   public int age;
   public String name;

   public Doge(int age, String name){
      this.age = age;
      this.name = name;
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {

      int x = 5;
      int y = 5;
      int z = 6;

      Doge fido = new Doge(5, "Fido");
      Doge doggo = new Doge(6, "Doggo");
      Doge fidoTwin = new Doge(5, "Fido");
      Doge fidoRealTwin = fido;
   }
}
```

If we plug this code into the java visualizer, we will see the box in pointer diagram shown below.

![](../.gitbook/assets/Doge.png)

Exercise 6.4.2: What would java return if we ran the following?

* `x == y`
* `x == z`
* `fido == doggo`
* `fido == fidoTwin`
* `fido = fidoRealTwin`

**Answers**

* `True`
* `False`
* `False`
* `False`
* `True`

`fido` and `fidoTwin` are not considered `==` because they point to different objects. However, this is quite silly since all their attributes are the same. You can see how `==` can cause some problems in Java testing. When we write tests for our ArrayList and want to check if expected is the same as what is returned by our function, we create expected as a new arraylist. If we used `==` in our test, it would always return false. This is what `equals(Object o)` is for.

## `equals(Object o)`

`equals(Object o)` is a method in the Object that, by default, acts like == in that it checks if the memory address of the this is the same as o. However, we can override it to define equality in whichever way we wish! For example, for two Arraylists to be considered equal, they just need to have the same elements in the same order.

**Exercise 6.4.3:** Let's write an equals method for the ArraySet class. Remember, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. So, for two sets to be considered equal, you just need to check if they have the same elements.

**Solution**

```java
public boolean equals(Object other) {
        if (this == other) {
            return true;
        }
        if (other == null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (other.getClass() != this.getClass()) {
            return false;
        }
        ArraySet<T> o = (ArraySet<T>) other;
        if (o.size() != this.size()) {
            return false;
        }
        for (T item : this) {
            if (!o.contains(item)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

We added a few checks in the beginning of the method to make sure our equals can handle nulls and objects of a different class. We also optimized the function by return true right away if the == methods returns true. This way, we avoid the extra work of iterating through the set.

**Rules for Equals in Java:** When overriding a `.equals()` method, it may sometimes be trickier than it seems. A couple of rules to adhere to while implementing your `.equals()` method are as follows:

1.\) `equals` must be an equivalence relation

* **reflexive**: `x.equals(x)` is true
* **symmetric**: `x.equals(y)` if and only if `y.equals(x)`
* **transitive**: `x.equals(y)` and `y.equals(z)` implies `x.equals(z)`

2.\) It must take an Object argument, in order to override the original `.equals()` method

3.\) It must be consistent if `x.equals(y)`, then as long as `x` and `y` remain unchanged: `x` must continue to equal `y`

4.\) It is never true for null `x.equals(null)` must be false
